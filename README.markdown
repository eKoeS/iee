# Improved Entry Editor (IEE)

Improved Entry Editor allows you to re-order fields from _inside_ the Entry Editor by means of a drag-and-drop interface. It also lets you collapse and expand fields in a Duplicator-like fashion.

There are many reasons why you could benefit from this extension:

* **Behaviour First, Appearance Later**: Defining a field's behaviour is conceptually different from changing its appearance. As such, these two tasks should be kept separate and perfomed in two distinct places.

* **Trial and Error**: You don't always know what is the best way (i.e. the one that feels _right_ to you) to place a field in a page until you actually see it along with other fields, arranged in a layout.

* **Instant feedback**: Jumping from the Section Editor to the Entry Editor and viceversa is time consuming: you need to change a page's look-and-feel from another page, then refresh the latter to see the outcome.

If any of that feels wrong to you, then this extension may prove very handy. Improved Entry Editor is a very little extension that can make the difference.

## Usage

* To re-order a field, click on the field's label, keep the mouse button down and drag the box around to reveal the available placeholders.
* To collapse/expand a field, perform a simple click on the field's label without moving it.
